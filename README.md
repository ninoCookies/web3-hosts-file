# Why should you host or backup your website on Web3? 
Hosting your website or app on a decentralized network of globally scattered nodes makes it unstoppable and defiant against single-point-of-access censorship.

# How does it work?
### IPFS
The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed system for peer-to-peer access and transfer of files, websites, apps, and data. When you upload a file to IPFS, it gets split into smaller chunks and cryptographically hashed. It also receives a unique fingerprint called a content identifier (CID), which acts as a permanent record of your file as it is at that point in time.

### Crust Network
Crust Network is a decentralized cloud storage provider on Polkadot. It supports multiple storage-layer protocols, such as IPFS, and delivers instantly accessible on-chain storage functions. Crust ºs technical stack also supports data manipulation and computing.

### Apillon Storage buckets
Decentralized hosting of a website or an app on Apillon is very similar to using storage buckets, a more dynamic way of managing file storage on Web3. It takes advantage of the underlying Crust Network and IPFS protocol to host your Web3 website or application.

# Instructions
